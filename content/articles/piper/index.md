The Paediatric Infant Perinatal Emergency Retrieval is designed for urgent stabilisation and retrieval of patients across Victoria. We are fortunate that they are able to extend their services to the transport of RCH patients between hospitals when treatment availability necessitates this.

## Contact
PIPER can be contacted on [1300 137 650](tel:1300137650)

## Elective transport
Some cases, such as neurointerventional procedures for arteriovenous malformation, require induction of anaesthesia + insertion of lines at RCH before transport.

PIPER should be involved in the planning of these cases as early as possible, and be called before the induction of anaesthesia to confirm availability of a transport team.

The anaesthetist + anaesthesia assistant will accompany a PIPER nurse + driver during transport.

Upon completion of the procedure, **strong consideration should be given to keeping the patient anaesthetised for transport back to RCH**. The patient may then be woken in RCH recovery or in a spare theatre, depending on staff availability.
