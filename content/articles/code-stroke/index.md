This document is designed to assist anaesthetists with managing a code stroke at RCH. It is intended as a supplement to the RCH code stroke protocol, but should not be used for decision-making.

## Overview
Anaesthetists may be required to assist at one or more points in the stroke pathway:
- To facilitate an MRI brain in a suspected stroke
- To provide anaesthesia for Endovascular Clot Retrieval at the Royal Melbourne Hospital

It is essential to communicate if there will be delays to providing anaesthesia assistance, as some patients may be amenable to eg. CT brain awake rather than GA MRI

## Medical Imaging

MRI is the preferred modality for code stroke imaging. Most patients will require general anaesthesia to achieve diagnostic-quality images.

The preferred pathway is:
- Patient anaesthetised and intubated in ED with RCH anaesthesia in attendance
- Responsibility for care handed over to the anaesthesia team for transfer to MRI and maintenance of anaesthesia during the scan
- Disposition to PACU, PICU, theatre or RCH interventional radiology as appropriate

In certain circumstances, CT is preferred to MRI as the primary imaging modality:
- VAD patients
- In the event of significant delay to anaesthetist or MRI availability
- Where a haemorrhagic stroke is felt to be the more likely pathology


## Transfer to the Royal Melbourne Hospital
If endovascular clot retrieval is required following review of the imaging, transfer to the Royal Melbourne Hospital via PIPER will be required.

The sequence of events should be as follows:
- Handover of responsibility from anaesthesia to PIPER in RCH ED/medical imaging
- PIPER will take primary responsibility for the patient during transfer to RMH
- Transport of patient via RMH ED to RMH interventional radiology
- RCH anaesthesia may travel with PIPER, or make their own way to RMH
- Handover from PIPER to RCH anaesthesia at RMH interventional radiology
- RCH anaesthesia takes primary responsibility for the patient during the endovascular procedure
- Handover from RCH anaesthesia to PIPER at the end of the procedure for transport back to RCH
