It can be convenient to transport crossmatched blood from RCH with the patient, in anticipation of blood loss during a procedure offsite.

## Contacts

RCH blood bank can be reached on [9345 5829](tel:0393455829)

## Blood shippers

Given that most procedures + transport takes longer than the 4 hour expiry on a standard blood box, it can be helpful to ask blood bank for a 'blood shipper':

![A Blood Shipper lasts up to 8 hours](blood-shipper.png "A 'blood shipper' lasts longer than a 'blood box'")

These products can be returned to blood bank unused up to 8 hours after provision.

## Documentation

The RCH blood bank has the ability to provide a 'compatibility report' along with the blood products they issue. This document can be used to check the blood products against the patient, and to serve as documentation of administration.

Note that the compatibility report will use RCH UR numbers only. This documentation should be returned to RCH for scanning once completed.
