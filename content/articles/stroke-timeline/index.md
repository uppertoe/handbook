A number of steps need to occur to ensure that the patient is available on the RMH EMR during a clot retrieval case. The following is a brief outline; please refer to the [endovascular clot retrieval guideline]("https://www.rch.org.au/clinicalguide/guideline_index/stroke/") for more detail.

The anaesthetist's responsibilities include:
<ul>
<li>Ensuring a secure airway is established</li>
<li>Obtaining arterial access</li>
<li>Liaising with RMH anaesthesia via <a href="tel:0393427000">RMH switchboard</a></li>
</ul>

{{< timelineItem header="Administration">}}
The RCH neurology fellow will ensure that the ECR case is booked, which is then scheduled by the RMH imaging clerical team.

<strong>RCH patients must be put on a leave of absence in EPIC and IBA</strong>

{{< timelineItem header="Transport to RMH" >}}
The PIPER registrar + nurse meet the stroke team at medical imaging, and transport the patient to the PIPER ambulance via ED.
<ul>
<li>Either the anaesthetist or the PIPER registrar may transport the patient with the PIPER nurse</li>
<li>The anaesthesia technician may need to travel separately, depending on seat availability in the PIPER ambulance</li>
<li>For VAD patients, the perfusionist or VAD nurse will also travel in the PIPER ambulance</li>
</ul>
{{</ timelineItem>}}

{{< timelineItem header="Arrival at RMH" >}}
The patient will need to be checked in at the RMH Emergency Department to obtain a UR number and nameband.
<ul>
<li>The stroke team will then be escorted by security to the angiography suite on level 1</li>
<li>If the anaesthesia technician has travelled separately from the stroke team, they will also need to present to ED and be escorted to the angiography suite. The PIPER nurse can assist with airway management in the meantime</li>
</ul>

{{< timelineItem icon="mug-hot" header="Return to RCH">}}
On arrival back at RCH, the patient will be suitable for either PICU or recovery.
<ul>
<li>The patient should be marked as returned from their leave-of-absence in Epic and IBA (PICU ward clerk, PICU ANUM, or reception J staff can help with this)</li>

<li>Any ongoing orders should be placed after this has occurred.</li>
</ul>
