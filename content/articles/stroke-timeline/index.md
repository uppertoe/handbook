A number of steps need to occur to ensure that the patient is available on the RMH EMR during a clot retrieval case. The following is a brief outline; please refer to the [endovascular clot retrieval guideline]("https://www.rch.org.au/clinicalguide/guideline_index/stroke/") for more detail.

The anaesthetist's responsibilities include:
<ul>
<li>Ensuring a secure airway is established</li>
<li>Obtaining arterial access</li>
<li>Liaising with RMH anaesthesia via <a href="tel:0393427000">RMH switchboard</a></li>
</ul>

The RCH neurology fellow will ensure that the ECR case is booked, which is then scheduled by the RMH imaging clerical team.
<br><br>
<strong>RCH patients must be put on a leave of absence in EPIC and IBA</strong>

{{< timelineItem header="Transport to RMH" >}}
The PIPER registrar + nurse meet the stroke team at medical imaging, and transport the patient to the PIPER ambulance via ED.
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Either the anaesthetist or the PIPER registrar may transport the patient with the PIPER nurse</li>
<li>The anaesthesia technician may need to travel separately, depending on seat availability in the PIPER ambulance</li>
<li>For VAD patients, the perfusionist or VAD nurse will also travel in the PIPER ambulance</li>
</ul>

{{< timelineItem icon="mug-hot" header="Return to RCH">}}
On arrival back at RCH, the patient will be suitable for either PICU or recovery.
<ul>
<li>The patient should be marked as returned from their leave-of-absence in Epic and IBA (PICU ward clerk, PICU ANUM, or reception J staff can help with this)</li>

<li>Any ongoing orders should be placed after this has occurred.</li>
</ul>
