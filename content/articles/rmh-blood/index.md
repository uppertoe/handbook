## Overview

Occasionally, patients transported for intervention at RMH require blood products. This document aims to help RCH anaesthetists navigate the systems across RCH and RMH to ensure that transfusion is safe and correctly documented.

## Helpful contacts

## Pre-tranfusion testing
Unfortunately, group and screen results are not transferable between RCH and RMH. This leaves three options for transfusing at RMH:

- Bringing crossmatched blood from RCH in a 'blood box' or 'shipper'
- Sending a sample for group and screen after the patient is checked in at RMH and has an RMH UR number
- Using O negative un-crossmatched blood

Note: bringing blood from RCH is not appropriate given the time

See [information on transporting blood](/articles/blood-transport) for information on using RCH blood offsite
