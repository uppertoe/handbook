This document is designed to assist anaesthetists with managing a code stroke at RCH. It is intended as a supplement to the RCH code stroke protocol, but should not be used for decision-making.

For further clinical information, please refer to the [RCH stroke clinical guideline](https://www.rch.org.au/clinicalguide/guideline_index/stroke/)

## Overview
Anaesthetists may be required to assist at one or more points in the stroke pathway:
- To facilitate an MRI brain in a suspected stroke
- To provide anaesthesia for Endovascular Clot Retrieval at the Royal Melbourne Hospital

It is essential to communicate if there will be delays to providing anaesthesia assistance, as some patients may be amenable to eg. CT brain awake rather than GA MRI
